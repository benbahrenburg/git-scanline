## Meet ZORP

ZORP is the surfing space invader mascot of git-scanline. He rides the git waves scanning
for hotspots — files that churn, crash, and revert while everyone else is catching clean
breaks. In terminal mode ZORP surfs live before every scan, alternating between two poses:

```
      FRAME A — standard pose         FRAME B — catching a wave
      ──────────────────────          ──────────────────────────
            |\  /|                          |\  /\
           (o \/ o)                        (o \/ o)
            |====|                          |====|
           /| || |\                        /| || |\
          / |_||_| \                      / |_||_| \
