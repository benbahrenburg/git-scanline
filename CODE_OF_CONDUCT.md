# Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

We are committed to making participation in this project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that build an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Taking responsibility for mistakes, apologizing, and learning from them
- Focusing on what is best for the community and project

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take fair, appropriate corrective action in response to behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, including issues, pull requests, discussions, and other communication channels managed for this project.

## Enforcement

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, report it to the maintainers by following the contact instructions in `SUPPORT.md`.

All reports will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. Privacy will be respected to the fullest extent possible.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Maintainers may use the following responses:

1. **Correction** — private or public clarification and request to stop behavior.
2. **Warning** — explicit notice that continued behavior will result in stronger action.
3. **Temporary Ban** — temporary restriction from project spaces.
4. **Permanent Ban** — removal from participation for severe or repeated violations.
